First Random Number
-------------------

Let's try to get a first random number z ~ N(0, 1).
It is easy to do with `normal` random number generator in the Statistics module.
To give the specific parameter, say the mean of 0 and the variance of 1, do:
*)

let generator = Statistics.normal (0.0, 1.0)

(**
The generator function is only able to use with a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).
The PRNG constructs a computation expression to generate random numbers.
The computation expression is a function which takes a random seed and returns a random number and a new seed for the next call.
It is important to keep the new state because it is used when you generate a new random number.

Here for example, you choose xorshift PRNG, which is implemented in FsRandom.
You need to define an initial random seed first for xorshift algorithm
(of course, another algorithm is available rather than xorshift, as described later).
It is a tuple composed of four 32-bit unsigned integers.
And then, you should combine the PRNG and the seed using `createState` function.
*)

let seed = 123456789u, 362436069u, 521288629u, 88675123u
let state = createState xorshift seed

(**
FsRandom also provides a default random state and a method to create a random state randomly for ease of use:
*)

Utility.defaultState
Utility.createRandomState ()

(**
Now you can retrieve a random number using `Random.get` function.
*)

(*** define-output:z1 ***)
let z1 = Random.get generator state
printf "z1 = %f" z1
(*** include-output:z1 ***)

(**
Since `Random.get` returns a stateless function,
if you do the code above, the same thing occurs.
*)

(*** define-output:z2 ***)
let z2 = Random.get generator state
printf "z2 = %f" z2
(*** include-output:z2 ***)

(**
To generate a new random number,
you need to get next state using `Random.next` instead of `Random.get`:
*)

(*** define-output:z3 ***)
let _, nextState = Random.next generator state
let z3 = Random.get generator nextState
printf "z3 = %f" z3
(*** include-output:z3 ***)

Transforming Random Numbers
---------------------------

Transformation of random numbers is a regular work.
FsRandom defines `Random.map` function for the purpose.
The following code shows how to use it.
*)

let plusOne x = x + 1.0
Random.map plusOne <| Statistics.uniform (0.0, 1.0)
|> Random.get
<| state

(**
`plusOne` is a function that takes an argument and adds one to it.
`uniform` is a uniform random number generator between its two arguments.
So `x` finally becomes a uniform random number between 1 and 2.

The both following codes return the same results as above.
*)

Random.identity <| Statistics.uniform (0.0, 1.0)
|> Random.get
<| state
|> plusOne

(** *)

Statistics.uniform (0.0, 1.0)
|> Random.get
<| state
|> plusOne

Random Number Sequence
----------------------

Usually, you use a lot of random numbers for our needs.
The following code defines a function generating an infinite binary sequence
using Bernoulli random number generator,
and it illustrates how you can generate a number of random numbers.
*)

let rec binaries initialState = seq {
   let binary, nextState = Random.next (Statistics.bernoulli 0.5) initialState
   yield binary
   yield! binaries nextState // recursively generating binaries.
}

(**
Or, more precisely like the following:
*)

let binaries2 state = Seq.ofRandom (Statistics.bernoulli 0.5) state

<a name="using-system-random"></a>
Using System.Random
-------------------

The examples above uses `xorshift` to generate random numbers.
The familliar `System.Random` (and its subclasses) is available in the workflow.
Just use `systemrandom` instead of `xorshift`.
*)

let r0 = System.Random ()
let s = createState systemrandom r0

(**
Because `System.Random` is a stateful object,
unlike `xorshift`, you will get different result on each call.
*)

let u1 = Random.get generator s
let u2 = Random.get generator s

Generator function
------------------

This section explains how to construct generator functions such like `normal` and `uniform`.

The type of generator function is `GeneratorFunction<'a>`,
where `'a` is a type of random numbers the generator function returns.

As an example of user-defined generator function,
let's construct a random number generator to produce an *approximate*
standard normal random number (approximately ~ N(0, 1)).
Theorem says that the mean of 12 standard random numbers,
namely, 12 random numbers between 0 and 1, approximates a normal random number
with mean of 1/2 and variance of 1/12.
Therefore, if you subtract 6 from the sum of 12 standard random numbers, the result
approximates a standard normal random number.
*)

let approximatelyStandardNormal = random {
   let! values = Array.randomCreate 12 ``(0, 1)``
   return Array.sum values - 6.0
}

(**
The `approximatelyStandardNormal` can be used in the generating process as the following.
*)

Random.get approximatelyStandardNormal state

(**
Don't forget that FsRandom has a normal random number generator `normal`.

<a name="pseudo-random-number-generators"></a>
Pseudo-random number generators
-------------------------------

This section explains how to implement pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithms such as `xorshift` and `systemrandom`.

A PRNG is often defined as a simple series of numbers whose next number is determined by the current state.
For example, the Xorshift algorithm has four 32-bit integers as a state.
To describe such PRNGs, the type of PRNGs in FsRandom is defined as `type Prng<'s> = 's -> uint64 * 's`.
Here `'s` is the type of random state of the PRNG.

As an example of user-defined `Prng`,
let's implement [linear congruential generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator).
First, you make a function of `Prng`.
*)

// Coefficients are cited from Wikipedia
let linear x = x, 6364136223846793005uL * x + 1442695040888963407uL

(**
The first returned value is a random number and the second returned value is a next state.
Note that modulus is not defined because `Prng` is required to return random numbers
in 64-bit resolution.

Hereafter you can use the `linear` PRNG to generate random numbers.
*)

let linearState = createState linear 0x123456789ABCDEFuL
Random.get generator linearState
